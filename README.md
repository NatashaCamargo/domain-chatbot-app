# SemanticBot 

This is a simple project using OpenAI API and Semantic search as an option to fine tuning. 
The initial goal was to build a ChatBot for specific knowledge domains and for this case the language
was PT-BR
The PineCone index was deleted and we have some TO-Dos:
- Add an option to use Llama 2
- Build a feature for the user to send documents to the Vector Database
